This file contains the description about the project.

The RMSLE is calculated as:
1n∑i=1n(log(1+y^i)−log(1+yi))2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
where:

n
 is the total number of observations in the test set,
y^i
 is the predicted value of the target for instance (i),
yi
 is the actual value of the target for instance (i), and,
log
 is the natural logarithm.

 this is the function that we require for calculating the accuracy of our model.
